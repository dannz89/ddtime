This repository was opened both for learning and use purposes. I saw a number of Stackoverflow and other posts requesting time-only handling for Typescript. 
I also needed this and although various solutions exist, it's both a good learning exercise and there can never bee too many Italian restaurants. All suggestions and
contributions are welcome however if you want to make contributions, please be clear on:

1. Reason for change / addition.
2. Impact on existing code users (changes in param types / order / number etc)
3. How to upgrade functionality for existing users.
